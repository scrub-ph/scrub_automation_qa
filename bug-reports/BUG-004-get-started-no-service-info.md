# BUG-004: Get Started Page Missing Service Information

## Bug Information
- **Bug ID**: BUG-004
- **Date Created**: 2025-10-25
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Priority**: P2
- **Status**: Open
- **Reporter**: QA Automation
- **Component**: Get Started Page Content

## Test Case
**Test File**: `tests/e2e/02-get-started.spec.ts`
**Test Name**: `should display service information or pricing`
**Line**: 98-107

## Bug Description
The get-started page is not displaying any service information or pricing details. The test looks for pricing indicators (₱, PHP, Starting, Price, Cost) but finds 0 elements, indicating no pricing or service information is available to help users make decisions.

## Expected Behavior
- Get-started page should display service information
- Pricing details should be visible (₱, PHP currency, rates)
- Users should see cost information to make informed decisions
- Service descriptions or pricing tiers should be available

## Actual Behavior
- Test finds 0 pricing/service information elements
- No currency symbols, pricing text, or service details detected
- Users have no pricing context for decision making

## Root Cause Analysis
This issue is related to BUG-003. Possible causes:
1. **Empty Page**: Get-started page has no content at all
2. **Wrong Route**: Test is on wrong page that doesn't have pricing
3. **Different Format**: Pricing information uses different text/format than expected
4. **Missing Content**: Page exists but pricing information not implemented
5. **Dynamic Loading**: Content loads after test runs

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to get-started page
2. Run test: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/02-get-started.spec.ts -g "should display service information"`
3. Observe test failure with 0 pricing elements found

## Expected Content Examples
The test should find elements containing:
- Currency symbols: ₱, PHP
- Pricing terms: Starting, Price, Cost, Rate
- Service terms: Service, Clean, Book, Hour

## Investigation Required
1. **Check actual get-started page content**: Manual inspection needed
2. **Verify SCRUB pricing strategy**: How/where is pricing displayed?
3. **Check other pages**: Maybe pricing is on different page (quote, book-now)
4. **Review user flow**: Understand where users see pricing in actual app

## Proposed Solutions
1. **If page is empty**: Fix BUG-003 first (missing page content)
2. **If wrong page**: Update test to navigate to correct pricing page
3. **If different format**: Update test selectors to match actual pricing format
4. **If missing**: File requirement for pricing information on get-started page

## Business Impact
- **User Experience**: Users can't see pricing before committing to service
- **Conversion**: Lack of pricing transparency may reduce conversions
- **Trust**: Users expect upfront pricing information

## Impact
- **User Impact**: Medium - Users need pricing info for decisions
- **Business Impact**: Medium - Pricing transparency affects conversions
- **Technical Impact**: Low - Test issue, functionality may work differently

## Environment
- **Browser**: Chrome
- **Test Framework**: Playwright
- **Application**: SCRUB Get Started Page
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000/get-started
