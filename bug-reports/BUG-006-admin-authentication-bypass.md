# BUG-006: Admin Dashboard Accessible Without Authentication

## Bug Information
- **Bug ID**: BUG-006
- **Date Created**: 2025-10-25
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Priority**: P1
- **Status**: Open
- **Reporter**: QA Automation
- **Component**: Admin Security

## Test Case
**Test File**: `tests/e2e/dashboard/admin-dashboard.spec.ts`
**Test Name**: `should require admin authentication`
**Line**: 6-8

## Bug Description
The admin dashboard is accessible without authentication, which is a critical security vulnerability. Users can directly navigate to `/admin-dashboard` without being redirected to the login page.

## Expected Behavior
- Unauthenticated users accessing `/admin-dashboard` should be redirected to `/sign-in`
- Admin dashboard should only be accessible after successful admin authentication
- Proper role-based access control should be enforced

## Actual Behavior
- Direct navigation to `/admin-dashboard` succeeds without authentication
- No redirect to sign-in page occurs
- Admin dashboard loads without verifying user credentials or role

## Security Implications
- **Unauthorized Access**: Anyone can access admin functions
- **Data Breach Risk**: Sensitive admin data exposed
- **System Compromise**: Admin controls accessible to unauthorized users
- **Compliance Issues**: Violates security best practices

## Test Evidence
```
Expected pattern: /.*sign-in/
Received string: "https://scrub-sync-mickymac19.replit.app/admin-dashboard"
```

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on SCRUB App.tsx analysis:
- Admin routes are protected by `isAuthenticated` check
- However, the authentication check may not be working properly
- Route protection logic may have bugs or be bypassed

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open browser in incognito/private mode
2. Navigate directly to `/admin-dashboard`
3. Observe: Admin dashboard loads without authentication
4. Expected: Should redirect to `/sign-in`

## Immediate Security Actions Required
1. **Block admin access**: Implement proper authentication checks
2. **Add role verification**: Ensure only admin users can access admin routes
3. **Audit all protected routes**: Check if other protected areas have same issue
4. **Review authentication middleware**: Fix authentication logic

## Impact Assessment
- **Security Impact**: CRITICAL - Complete admin security bypass
- **Business Impact**: CRITICAL - Unauthorized admin access possible
- **Compliance Impact**: HIGH - Security policy violations

## Environment
- **Application URL**: https://scrub-sync-mickymac19.replit.app/admin-dashboard
- **Browser**: Chrome
- **Test Framework**: Playwright

## Recommended Fix
Update authentication logic in App.tsx to properly check user authentication and role before allowing access to admin routes.
