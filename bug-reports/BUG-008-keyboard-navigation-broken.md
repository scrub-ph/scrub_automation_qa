## Bug Information
- **Bug ID**: BUG-008
- **Date Created**: 2025-10-25
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Priority**: P2
- **Status**: Open
- **Reporter**: QA Automation
- **Component**: Accessibility / Login Form

## Test Case
**Test File**: `tests/e2e/auth/authentication.spec.ts`
**Test Name**: `Login form keyboard navigation works`
**Line**: 118-129

## Bug Description
Keyboard navigation is not working properly on the login form. When using Tab key to navigate through form fields, the focus does not reach the Sign In button as expected, failing accessibility requirements.

## Expected Behavior
- Tab key should navigate through all form elements in logical order
- Focus should move from email field → password field → sign in button
- Sign in button should receive focus when tabbed to
- Form should be fully accessible via keyboard

## Actual Behavior
- Tab navigation does not properly focus the sign in button
- Button remains in "inactive" state instead of "focused"
- Keyboard accessibility is broken

## Accessibility Impact
- **WCAG Compliance**: Violates keyboard accessibility guidelines
- **User Experience**: Users relying on keyboard navigation cannot use the form
- **Disability Access**: Prevents users with motor disabilities from logging in

## Error Details
```
Error: expect(locator).toBeFocused() failed
Locator: locator('button[type="submit"]')
Expected: focused
Received: inactive
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **CSS Focus Issues**: Button may have CSS that prevents proper focus styling
2. **Tab Index Problems**: Incorrect tabindex values or missing focus management
3. **JavaScript Interference**: Event handlers may be preventing focus
4. **Form Structure Issues**: HTML structure may not support proper tab order

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to /sign-in page
2. Use Tab key to navigate through form fields
3. Observe: Sign in button does not receive focus properly
4. Expected: Button should be visibly focused and accessible

## Impact Assessment
- **Accessibility Impact**: HIGH - Breaks keyboard accessibility
- **Legal Impact**: MEDIUM - May violate accessibility regulations
- **User Impact**: MEDIUM - Affects users who rely on keyboard navigation

## Recommended Fixes
1. **Review CSS Focus Styles**: Ensure button has proper :focus styles
2. **Check Tab Order**: Verify tabindex values are correct
3. **Test Focus Management**: Ensure no JavaScript is interfering with focus
4. **Add Focus Indicators**: Make focus states clearly visible

## Testing Requirements
- Manual keyboard testing needed
- Screen reader testing recommended
- Focus indicator visibility verification

## Environment
- **Browser**: Chrome
- **Test Framework**: Playwright
- **Page**: /sign-in
