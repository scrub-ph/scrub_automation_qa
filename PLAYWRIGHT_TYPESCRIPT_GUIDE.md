# Playwright with TypeScript - Complete Implementation Guide

## 🎭 What is Playwright?
Playwright is a modern end-to-end testing framework that allows you to test web applications across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with a single API.

## 🔧 Core Concepts

### 1. Page Object Model (POM)
Separates test logic from page interactions. Each page has its own class with methods and locators.

### 2. TypeScript Benefits
- Type safety
- IntelliSense support
- Better error catching
- Code documentation

### 3. Test Structure
- `test.describe()` - Groups related tests
- `test()` - Individual test cases
- `test.beforeEach()` - Setup before each test
- `test.afterEach()` - Cleanup after each test
